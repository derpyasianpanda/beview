## Setup

1. Go to the config folder in the server directory and reference the configLayout.env
to create your own config.env file
2. Make sure all the client side API calls are changed to the correct link
(Sorry! I hard coded it)
3. Setup your PostgreSQL database using the first two SQL queries in the db directory
4. Make sure all the node modules are there to properly run the website
5. Run the client and the server

## Technology Stack

This web app uses the PERN stack:

Additionally, I used Bootstrap for styling and Fontawesome for icons.
